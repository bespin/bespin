Welcome to the Bespin Code Illuminated project that tries to show the Bespin code in a pretty way.

To get this working, you need to create a directory named "code" in this directory that points to the frontend/js directory of Bespin.

Ideally you would do this via a symlink (this is what we do on the server) but you can copy the files over too:

E.g.

cp -r /path/to/bespin/frontend/js /path/to/bespin/docs/code
