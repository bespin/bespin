Welcome to Bespin!
------------------

Bespin is a Mozilla Labs experiment on how to build an extensible Web code editor using HTML 5 technology.

Live system: https://bespin.mozilla.com/


Thanks for downloading the code to the Bespin project. You can easily get Bespin running on your local Mac or Linux machine (see note about Windows below).

To run Bespin locally, go to backend/python and take a look at the README.txt file there.

Note about running on Windows
-----------------------------

The current, up-to-date Bespin backend is written in Python. Because Python is cross-platform, it should be possible (and likely not too difficult) to make the backend work on Windows once Python 2.5 is installed. However, this has not been tested and there are likely two issues:

1. some libraries used by Bespin try to compile C code
2. some paths may not be correct on Windows systems
