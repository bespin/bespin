This is where your custom themes go.

There are a few ways to create a new theme:

- Run "theme install http://path/to/theme" and it will copy it in
- Manually create a file named YourTheme.js that has the correct values in it (copy another theme such as the "greenonblack.js" to make sure)

Now you can "set theme YourTheme" to see it in action.
