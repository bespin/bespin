 Bespin Plugins Directory
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is where your Bespin plugins go.

There are a few ways to install a new plugin:

- Run "plugin install http://path/to/theme" and it will copy it in here
- Manually create a file named YourPlugin.js that has the correct values in it (copy another theme to make sure)

Now you can "plugin load YourPlugin" to see it in action.
