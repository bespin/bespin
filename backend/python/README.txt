Bespin Python Server
====================

This program provides the server side functionality for Bespin.

Getting Started
---------------

Run::

  python bootstrap.py
  
to get the environment set up. This is built around virtualenv. All of the
required packages will automatically be installed. Once this is set up,
you can run::

  source bin/activate
  
to enter the virtualenv. Alternatively, you can just prefix the commands you
run with "bin/". If you wish to restore your command line environment,
you can type "deactivate".

You can start up the development server by running::

  paver start
  
You can run the unit tests by running::

  py.test bespin
  
Updating the Required Files
---------------------------

If the "requirements.txt" file changes, you can re-install the required packages
by running::

  paver required
  
You can also force upgrade all of the packages like so::

  pip install -U -r requirements.txt

Understanding the Code
----------------------

The BespinServer is built entirely out of WSGI components (to see which 
packages are used, check out requirements.txt).

The data is all stored by Shove, which provides a simple key->value mapping 
backed by a number of different backing stores. The values are all pickled 
python, so they can be arbitrary objects. This makes data persistence very
easy and lets us choose appropriate backends for the deployment needs.

bespin/model.py contains the model objects and the "manager" objects that
know how to store and retrieve them from the Shove. These manager objects
are inserted into the WSGI environment.

There is a very trivial "web framework" in bespin/framework.py. This provides
a simple wrapper for:

1. Handling authentication as needed (which is most URLs)
2. Providing Request and Response objects that are simpler to use than the
   standard WSGI environ, start_response parameters. These are just small
   subclasses of WebOb's Request and Response.
3. Providing a decorator that expresses which URL a given function responds
   to (wrapping the behavior of urlrelay).
   
Authentication is managed by repoze.who, with our customized classes coming
from bespin/auth.py.

bespin/controllers.py contains the functions that respond to the URLs. It
also contains the make_app function, which knows how to construct the WSGI
application that will appear on the web.

bespin/config.py knows how to configure the system based on "profiles"
such as "test", "dev" and "prod".

bespin/tests contains the unit tests.
